The snake park has successfully managed to acquaint thousands of visitors with the unusual and fascinating wildlife through its extensive collection of snakes, reptiles, birds and turtles.</p>
        
                <p>
                    The Katraj Snake Park is a time-tested proof that fantastic and fun-filled places necessarily need not be expensive. The snake park is home to over 22 species of snakes with ten species of reptiles, that comprises of more than 150 individuals. This marvellous collection also includes a 13-foot long king cobra. In 1986, Mr Neelam Kumar Khaire, who was the first director of the park, with assistance from the Pune Municipal Corporation, had created the Katraj Snake Park on the land that was to become the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park later on. The park since then has garnered thousands of nature enthusiasts and animal lovers.
                    
                </p>
                <p>The Snake Park organises a myriad of snake festivals and snake awareness programs to clarify doubts that people may have about snakes and to destroy fears about snakes. During Nag Panchami, the park also arranges programs that aim to focus on discouraging the ill-treatment of snakes. The species of snakes include Cobra, Pythons and Russell's vipers. Think of the Katraj Snake Park, and words like joy, laughter, fun and family moments would immediately pop up in your mind. This is exactly why a visit to this tourist attraction is a must to again get in touch with your lost childhood and adventurous streak.</p></p>
